# maidmate
MAID MATE is a web application designed for quick pairing customers(service users) and service providers on household maid services.
Service providers could register with their service category(e.g. home cleaning, cooking and pet caring), service region, service day and time.
On the other hand, service users upon successful registration and login could choose the service they want, service plan, service day and time.
The system would then autmatically generate a list of the service providers, which match with the criteria, to the service users to choose.
The steps are easy and convenient !!
